This repository serves as a basis for how to reliably reproduce the mock reads used for analyzing StrainR2's accuracy and performance.

For the same results, please use InSilicoSeq version 1.5.4.

Reads will be generated by running the two shell files included in this repository. One will generate mock reads from the sFMT community, while the other will geenrate mock reads from the mock community of 22 Eggerthella lenta strains.
